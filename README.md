#Assignment 3: RNN for NLP

The goal of this assignment is to learn how to implement and use recursive neural network for classification and for language modeling using Pytorch. Pytorch is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks in both industry and academia, and learning its use will be invaluable should you choose a career in deep learning. You will be using Pytorch for this assignment, and instead of providing you source code, we ask you to build off a couple Pytorch tutorials.

1. run main.py for the first question and main2.py for the second question
2. result.pdf shown all the result and explanation including the loss and confusion_matrix  pictures
3. For the first part the parameters is the highest one I test which is:n_hiddens is:  100, learning_rate is:  0.0015, n_iter is:  150000. For the second part the parameters is n_epochs = 2000, hidden_size = 100, learning_rate = 0.005, temperature=1
