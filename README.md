1. run main.py for the first question and main2.py for the second question
2. result.pdf shown all the result and explanation including the loss and confusion_matrix  pictures
3. For the first part the parameters is the highest one I test which is:n_hiddens is:  100, learning_rate is:  0.0015, n_iter is:  150000. For the second part the parameters is n_epochs = 2000, hidden_size = 100, learning_rate = 0.005, temperature=1
